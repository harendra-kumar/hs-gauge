-- Types for benchmarking.
--
-- The core type is 'Benchmarkable', which admits both pure functions
-- and 'IO' actions.
--
-- For a pure function of type @a -> b@, the benchmarking harness
-- calls this function repeatedly, each time with a different 'Int64'
-- argument (the number of times to run the function in a loop), and
-- reduces the result the function returns to weak head normal form.
--
-- For an action of type @IO a@, the benchmarking harness calls the
-- action repeatedly, but does not reduce the result.
